3580. Find Consistently Improving Employees

Table: employees

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row contains information about an employee.
Table: performance_reviews

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| review_id   | int  |
| employee_id | int  |
| review_date | date |
| rating      | int  |
+-------------+------+
review_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row represents a performance review for an employee. The rating is on a scale of 1-5 where 5 is excellent and 1 is poor.
Write a solution to find employees who have consistently improved their performance over their last three reviews.

An employee must have at least 3 review to be considered
The employee's last 3 reviews must show strictly increasing ratings (each review better than the previous)
Use the most recent 3 reviews based on review_date for each employee
Calculate the improvement score as the difference between the latest rating and the earliest rating among the last 3 reviews
Return the result table ordered by improvement score in descending order, then by name in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example:

Explanation:

Alice Johnson (employee_id = 1):
Has 4 reviews with ratings: 2, 3, 4, 5
Last 3 reviews (by date): 2023-04-15 (3), 2023-07-15 (4), 2023-10-15 (5)
Ratings are strictly increasing: 3 → 4 → 5
Improvement score: 5 - 3 = 2
Carol Davis (employee_id = 3):
Has 4 reviews with ratings: 1, 2, 3, 4
Last 3 reviews (by date): 2023-06-10 (2), 2023-09-10 (3), 2023-12-10 (4)
Ratings are strictly increasing: 2 → 3 → 4
Improvement score: 4 - 2 = 2
Bob Smith (employee_id = 2):
Has 4 reviews with ratings: 3, 2, 4, 5
Last 3 reviews (by date): 2023-05-01 (2), 2023-08-01 (4), 2023-11-01 (5)
Ratings are strictly increasing: 2 → 4 → 5
Improvement score: 5 - 2 = 3
Employees not included:
David Wilson (employee_id = 4): Last 3 reviews are all 4 (no improvement)
Emma Brown (employee_id = 5): Only has 2 reviews (needs at least 3)
The output table is ordered by improvement_score in descending order, then by name in ascending order.
